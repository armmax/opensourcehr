# Expert Sqreen Script - Agent Engineer role

## Intro

Thanks so much for taking the time to talk with me today! The idea of this call is to give you a better idea about the technical details of the opportunity we have here at Sqreen. Does that sound okay for you? 

Great! First of all, I understand you’re currently working at XYZ (let the candidate know we communicate internally!), but you’re open to the idea of a more low level role is that right? 

Great, and what did you understand about Sqreen from your call with Alison?

## Sqreen stories

To give you a bit more context, I co-founded Sqreen in 2015 after more than 6 years working in Apple's Red team. What’s great about Sqreen for me is... (adapt for yourself!)

Right now we’re looking for talented agent engineers to join us across our different squads, the XYZ squad focuses on… (explain the different squads briefly).

## Role-specific questions

We’re looking for someone with excellent knowledge of Python internals, experience with NoSQL databases… (adapt for role). 

* Can you tell me a bit more about your experience with Python in production?
* Have you already done production code? Has it been used on an infrastructure with serving customer requests?
* Do you know what's in an HTTP request?
* How do you test? How do you debug?
* Tell me about a cool project you have been working on
* How do people usually deploy productions in X?
* What's the difference betweeen a thread and a process?

## Next steps

Are there any other questions I could answer today, about Sqreen, the team, the role itself?

To let you know how our process works, after the Expert Sqreen, which we’ve just done today we then move on to the Technical Sqreen which is a take-home exercise that can be completed in around 2 hours, and then all being well we invite you to the Sqreenhouse for half a day to meet the rest of the team and go through a series of discussions. I can get back to you before close of business tomorrow regarding the next step if that works for you?

Thanks again for your time, it was a real pleasure chatting with you! Have a lovely day!
