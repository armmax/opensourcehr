# Sqreen-starts
## Onboarding for success
* Be prepared - nothing says "welcome!" more than an organised desk complete with computer and a few goodies on day one. The opposite is also true. 
* Get the basics right - that means work contract, health insurance and other paperwork signed and completed on the first day, access to email and all other tools done in advance and a central place to find the information a new Sqreener might want over the next days and weeks. We use a Trello board to coordinate this, but I suggest sticking with whatever tool your team is used to using (JIRA, anyone? :) ). 
* Share your culture - it's no secret that Sqreeners love to eat, so we make sure to share breakfast on the Sqreener's first day and plan a team lunch in a restaurant and an apéro (drinks and snacks night) during the Sqreener's first week. If the new Sqreener is also new to the city (Paris or San Francisco), we go out of our way to share our favourite addresses and things to do (spoiler alert, many of them include eating). We onboard all of our San Franciscan team here in Paris, and ensure all of the Paris team travel to SF regularly.
