# Talent Sqreen Script

## Intro

Thanks so much for taking the time to talk with me today! The idea of this call is to give you a better idea about who we are here at Sqreen and to also understand what you might be looking for in your next challenge. Does that sound okay for you? 

First of all, had you heard a little bit about Sqreen before applying / before I reached out?

To give you a bit more context, Sqreen was founded about 3 years ago by two former colleagues who had worked together at Apple, in the Red team, testing for vulnerabilities in Apple’s internal products. During this experience Jean-Baptiste and Pierre noticed a significant gap between developers and security teams. Traditionally, the security industry is very closed and mysterious, and security vendors prefer to keep it this way. Sqreen is different, Sqreen is on a mission to democratise security for developers. We do this both via our product itself - by adding just a few lines of code any developer can deploy Sqreen within their web app and benefit from anomaly detection and real time automated responses and protection, but also via our culture. We participate actively in the broader developer community, our Sqreeners are encouraged to speak at meetups and conferences and to share blog posts about their work. We even open source some of our projects, which is quite unusual for a security company. 

Sqreen was launched with a beta of 20 customers which allowed us to raise our seed round with Alven and Point Nine. Fast forward to the beginning of 2018 and the team attended YCombinator in San Francisco which allowed us to iterate really quickly and improve our product in leaps and bounds. 

Right now we’re a little over 20 in the team, mostly engineers and mostly based in Paris with a sales and marketing focused team in San Francisco. Right now we’re looking to grow the team in both locations. And in particular we’re looking for (role of interest) which is where you come in!

Was that quite clear as an introduction, are there any questions on that so far?

## About the candidate

Okay great, now I’d love to hear a little more about you, where you’re at right now, why you might be thinking about making a move?  What would be the ideal next role for you? 

Why might Sqreen be an interesting opportunity for you? 

Role-specific screening questions. (ex: Why Python? Can you tell me more about memory management in Ruby?)


## Logistics

I imagine you’re speaking with other companies, what sort of industries / company sizes are you considering? Similar role responsibilities to ours? 

If you did find the role of your dreams, when might you be available to start?

Do you have an idea of what you might be seeking in terms of salary in your next role?

Are there any other questions I could answer today, about Sqreen, the team, the role itself?

## Next steps

To let you know how our process works, after the Talent Sqreen, which we’ve just done today we then move on to the Expert Sqreen, which is a 30-minute zoom call with (the subject matter expert in the team). If this call is successful we move on to a Technical Sqreen which is a take-home exercise that can be completed in around 2 hours, and then all being well we invite you to the Sqreenhouse for half a day to meet the rest of the team and go through a series of discussions. I can get back to you before close of business tomorrow regarding the next step if that works for you?

Thanks again for your time, it was a real pleasure chatting with you! Have a lovely day!
