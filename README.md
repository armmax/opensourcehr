# Open Source HR
HR in startups is hard, but what if it didn't have to be? What if we applied open source thinking to HR?

That is, what if we shared our internal policies and processes? Shared the basic building blocks for others to adapt, evolve and then share back? What if we shone a light on a subject that is so often kept in the shadows?

What if we did it today?

Welcome to Open Source HR.
